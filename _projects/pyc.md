PYC is an interpreted C-like programming language written with Python 3.

This project also contains a demo editor, built using ReactJS on the frontend (hosted on Vercel) and FastAPI on the backend (hosted on Fly.io), allows you to write and test code in PYC.

The demo editor can be found at <https://pyc.vercel.app/>.

For more information, check out the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/876pol/pyc>.
