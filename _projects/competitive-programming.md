## Competitive Programming

I have been training for competitive programming contests, specifically to achieve results in contests such as the CCC and USACO. I have also used sites such as Codeforces, AtCoder, and DMOJ for practice problems and contests.

After practicing competitive programming for over two years, I have begun to see results, including:

- **2023 Canadian Computing Competition Senior Division**: Group I Honor Roll, >99th percentile, Qualification to 2023 Canadian Computing Olympiad.
- **USA Computing Olympiad Platinum Division**

## Competitive Math

More recently, I have begun to practice for math contests, seeing results such as:

- **2023 Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge**: Grade 11 Eastern Ontario Honorable Mention, >90th percentile
- **2023 AIME Qualification**
- **2023 Fermat**: Group V Honor Roll, 98th percentile
