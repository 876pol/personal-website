## Competitive Programming

I have been training for competitive programming contests, specifically to achieve results in contests such as the CCC and USACO. I have also used sites such as Codeforces, AtCoder, and DMOJ for practice problems and contests.

After practicing competitive programming for over two years, I have begun to see results, including:

- 63/75 on the 2023 Canadian Computing Competition Senior Division, Group I Honor Roll, >99th percentile, Qualification to 2023 Canadian Computing Olympiad.
- USA Computing Olympiad Platinum Division

Additionally, my online competitive programming profiles are as follows:

## Competitive Math

More recently, I have begun to practice for math contests, seeing results such as:

- 51.75/80 on the 2023 Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge, Grade 11 Eastern Ontario Honorable Mention, >90th percentile
- 102.5/150 on the 2023 American Mathematics Contest 12A, qualification to the 2023 American Invitational Mathematics Examination
- 5/15 on the 2023 American Invitational Mathematics Examination I, >50 percentile
- 124/150 on the 2023 Fermat, Group V Honor Roll, 98th percentile
